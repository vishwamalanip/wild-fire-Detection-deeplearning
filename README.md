Modern detection technologies are required to
reduce possible damages, safeguard human life, and preserve
ecosystems despite the growing threat of wildfires.
Here, we do a thorough analysis of machine learning (ML)
techniques for detecting wildfires, emphasizing deep transfer
learning approaches, YOLOv9, a practical object detection
algorithm, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Using the
well-annotated DFireDataset, which contains a wide range of
fire and smoke picture collections, we conduct a critical literature
review to examine several machine learning techniquesâ€™
methods, architectures, and performance metrics. Phases of
data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, and
assessment are all included in our research. After extensive
testing, we find that when considering accuracy, precision,
and recall, CNNs, deep transfer learning, and YOLOv9 are
viable options for accurate wildfire identification. We provide
a thorough project execution schedule highlighting essential
stages, including data collection, model creation, deployment,
and assessment. Our results highlight how CNNs, deep transfer
learning, and YOLOv9 can all effectively identify fire and
smoke incidents, advancing wildfire detection technologies. Our
study improves our capacity to tackle this pressing environmental
issue by integrating digital image processing and machine
learning techniques.
